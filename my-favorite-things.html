    <p>

        Hiking and Nature Walks make me fill at peace, live, enjoy the moment. This stirred my interest in Bird Watching 
        and identifying which birds live in a particular area. I also took an interest in herping because snakes, frogs 
        and Lizards because in the African setting they are undervalued, misunderstood, and a lot of negative history has
        been pass down from generations. When they are very gentle and secluded creatures with a lot of ecological value.

    <p>When at home I love listening to music or watching anything adventure fiction, sci-fi, detective crime movies/programs 
        and nature documentary </p>
